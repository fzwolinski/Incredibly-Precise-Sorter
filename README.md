# 💯 Incredibly Precise Sorter

**Incredibly Precise Sorter** is a console program which allows You to:

- sort a sequence of numbers loaded from a _TXT_ file
- save sorted sequence in a new _TXT_ file
- measure the sorting time for individual algorithm

<br />

#### 📐 Available algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- IntroSort (using sort() from STD)
- Selection Sort

<br />

## 💻 Compile and Run

```sh
foo@bar:~$ g++ main.cpp sorter.cpp timer.cpp
```

Windows

```sh
foo@bar:~$ a.exe
```

Linux

```sh
foo@bar:~$ ./a.out
```

<br />

## 🚪 Example output

```sh
   [Bubble Sort]  Took:  84553696 µs   (84553.696 ms) (84s) to sort 100000 numbers
[Insertion Sort]  Took:  23972002 µs   (23972.002 ms) (23s) to sort 100000 numbers
      [STD Sort]  Took:     34998 µs      (34.998 ms)  (0s) to sort 100000 numbers
[Selection Sort]  Took:  21615517 µs   (21615.517 ms) (21s) to sort 100000 numbers
```

<br />

## ⌨️ Example usage

First create sequence of _n_ random numbers

```sh
foo@bar:~$ python create_file_with_nums.py
```

Then edit main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "sorter.h"

int main() {
  Sorter s;
  s.load_numbers("nums.txt");

  s.run_bubble_sort();
  s.run_insertion_sort();
  s.run_std_sort();
  s.run_selection_sort();

  return 0;
}
```
